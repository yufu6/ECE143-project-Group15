# ECE143-project-Group15
This is the Pet Analysis project for ECE 143


For running the top5 cat and dog code, need import plotly, plotly.io, numpy, pandas, json
There are five api and secert password in the code since the petfinder API can only access 1000 API calls pre day.
In the top_5 cat python file, load cat in seperate days. Due to that reason, manually add the data into dictionary.
In the top_5 dog data, we improve that save all the data into json file.
